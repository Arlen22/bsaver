# tiddlysaver - proof of concept only -

Aim
1. To enable tiddlywikis to be saved like a file, i.e. the new (modified) version overwrites the old version.
2. To provide automatic backups.

## Scope and limitations
1. This is a browser extension designed to work with chrome and other chromium, and the new firefox browser (v57 and latter).
2. Due to browser restrictions tiddlywikis must be located below a subdir of the 'Download' directory.

## Getting started
1. Install by downloading and unzipping. Then in chrome navigate to chrome://extensions/ and click 'load unpacked extension' and go the tiddlysaver/extension/dir to select the extension.
2. Create a subdir called tiddlywikilocations in the Dowload dir. 
3. Download a tiddlywiki from http://tiddlywiki.com/, and place in that subdir.
